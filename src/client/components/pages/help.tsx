					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<br/>
					<h4>How do I add a book?</h4>
					First and foremost, search for both the author and the title of the book to avoid creating duplicates.
					<br/>If a Work and an Edition containing it exist, the questions below will help you decide whether to create a new Edition.
					<br/>Otherwise, here is a step-by-step procedure:
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<ol>
						<li>Find or add a new {genEntityIconHTMLElement('Author')}Author</li>
						<li>On the Author page, click on &#39;Add Work&#39; to create a {genEntityIconHTMLElement('Work')}Work with a relationship to the Author</li>
						<li>On the Work page, click &#39;Add Edition&#39; to create an {genEntityIconHTMLElement('Edition')}Edition with a relationship to the Work.
							<ul>
								<li>A new {genEntityIconHTMLElement('EditionGroup')}Edition Group will be created automatically, but you can select an existing one</li>
								<li>Create a new {genEntityIconHTMLElement('Publisher')}Publisher if you cannot find an existing one</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>To enter another format of the same book (see explanations below), go to the Edition Group and click the &#x27;Add Edition&#x27; button. Repeat step 4.</li>
					</ol>
					<br/>
					<h4>When should I create a new Edition of a Work?</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>When it is published in a different format (e.g. paperback and e-book)</li>
						<li>When there are substantial content (textual or editorial) changes</li>
						<li>Translations will both be a new Work and a new Edition for it.</li>
						<li>Add a relationship between the original and the translated Works</li>
						<li>New cover or changed credits/attribution on the cover</li>
						<li>When there&#x27;s a new ISBN</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<h4>When should I <i>not</i> create a new Edition of a Work?</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Minimal changes as in proofreading errors</li>
						<li>Minimal changes on the cover</li>
						<li>Reprints of the same Edition. You can mention “Reprint – [date]” in the annotations.</li>
						<li>When the edition uses the same ISBN (with rare exceptions)</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<h4>When should two Editions be part of the same Edition Group?</h4>
					Edition Groups exist to group together all the variations of an edition (an identifiable set of works) in a given language.
					Here are examples of Editions that should be part of the same Edition Group:
					<br/>
					<ul>
						<li>Different formats of the same edition (paperback, hardcover and e-book by the same publisher)</li>
						<li>Revised and updated editions</li>
						<li>Reprints</li>
						<li>Editions with different forewords/intros</li>
						<li>Co-editions (same book published in different countries by different publishers)</li>
					</ul>
